[![conventional commits](https://img.shields.io/badge/Conventional%20Commits-1.0.0-yellow.svg)](https://conventionalcommits.org)

## Purpose

This is a collection of GitHub Actions that we use for our projects @[okp4] and that can be useful to others.

All the workflows and actions defined in this repository promotes the practices of CI (i.e. Continuous Integration) and CD (Continuous Deployment|Delivery) and enable the automation of operations that cover the following categories:

- Code quality
- Code review
- Dependency management
- Build
- Deployment
- Testing
- Publishing
- Utilities

## Workflows

The actions are organized arount serveral workflows.

### Lint

[workflows/lint.yml](workflows/lint.yml)

Part of the code quality analysis, ensure the homogeneity of the codebase. The workflow contains a large set of jobs to deal with different project typologies (technology, programming language...)

## Usage

The workflows contain reusable GitHub actions that can be used as a base recipe for your workflow. Just pick the ones you're interrested in and add them to your `.github/workflows/xxxx.yml` workflow file in your repository.

## Access Token

Most jobs need a specific access token with appropriate permissions to run correctly. This token is named `OKP4_TOKEN`, and is defined at the level of the organization. If needed, read the documentation on creating a [PA token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).
